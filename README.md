## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Each player starts with nine pieces (usually represented by different colors) and takes turns placing them on the board, one at a time, until all pieces are placed.
2. **Moving Phase**: After all pieces are placed, players take turns moving their pieces to adjacent empty spots on the board.
3. **Forming Mills**: If a player aligns three of their pieces in a straight line (a "mill"), they can remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board.
4. **Flying Phase**: Once a player has only three pieces left, they can "fly" their pieces to any empty spot on the board instead of moving to adjacent ones.
5. **Winning**: A player wins by either leaving their opponent with only two pieces, making it impossible for the opponent to form a mill, or by blocking all of their opponent's pieces so they cannot move.
